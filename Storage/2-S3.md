## S3 :  

### Object storage 

* Distributes across atleast three Availability zones. 

* Except: 1A (1 zone, least expensive) (low availability and low cost ) 

* Supports encryption and automatic data classification 

### Getting data into S3: 

- API 

- Amazon Direct Connect 

- Storage Gateway (sync local and s3 bucket) 

- Transfer Acceleration 

- Snow family 

  * Snowball (Petabyte-scale) 

  * snowball Edge (100 TB Local Storage) 

  * Snowmobile (Exabyte-scale) 

### S3 Concepts: 

* Buckets (container to store objects) 

    - Like drives in local computer 

* Regions 

* Objects (things which are stored in s3 buckets) 

* Keys 

* Object URLs 

### Eventual Consistency  

- Objects in S3 buckets have eventual consistency. 

- (Objects in Elastic Block Stores are consistent.) 

Works great for static website hosting 

### Common S3 Operations: 

- Creating and deleting buckets 

- Writing, Reading and Deleting objects 

- Managing object properties 

- Listing Keys in buckets 

### REST Interface: 

- Representation State Transfer (REST) 

  * S3 API 

  * Maps HTTP methods to CRUD operations 

    - Create uses PUT or POST 

    - Read uses GET 

    - Update uses POST or PUT 

    - Delete uses DELETE 

### S3 Features: 

* Prefixes and delemeters 

* Storage classes. Choosing the right storage class is based on performance and cost 

  - Amazon S3 standard  ($$$$$$)

  - Amazon S3 Infrequent Access (IA) Storage ($$$$)

  - Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) ($$ )

  - Glacier ($) (But very expense if we retrieving file frequently.) 

* Encryption (storage security) 

* Automatic decrypt at end when retrive data  

* Versioning (by default not enabled.  Once enabled it could not disabled.) 

* Multifactor Authentication(MFA) delete 

* Multi-part upload 

* Range GETs 

* Cross-Region replication 

* Logging 

* Event notifications 

## Lab concepts: 

### Bucket level properties: 

* Object properties includes storage class, encryption, metadata and tags 

* Metadata is used to define the purpose of the object 

* Tags are usedto search, organize, and manage access 

### Object level properties: 

* Folders - its not actual folders just prefixes. 

  When you create a folder, S3 console creates an object with the name appended by suffix "/" and that object is displayed as a folder in the S3 console. 

* We can add AES-256 encryption to any object 

* When creating S3 bucket folders, prefixes are added to objects so that they appear as folders. 

* An object can have up to 10 tags.
